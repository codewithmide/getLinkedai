## Challenges

During the development of GetLinkedAI, I encountered several challenges related to the use of various technologies and tools. These challenges included:

- **Integrating Formik and Yup:** Incorporating Formik and Yup for form management and validation posed an initial learning curve. I needed to understand how to seamlessly integrate these libraries into my project.

- **Styling with Tailwind CSS:** Enhancing the user interface and achieving a polished design with Tailwind CSS required me to improve my CSS skills. Customizing the styles to align with my vision was a challenge.

- **Data Handling with Axios:** Efficiently handling data requests and responses using Axios required careful implementation, error handling, and optimization.

I overcame these challenges by:

- **In-Depth Documentation:** I extensively referred to Formik and Yup documentation, ensuring that I fully understood their capabilities and best practices. This helped me integrate them smoothly.

- **CSS Practice:** I dedicated time to practicing and improving my CSS skills, experimenting with Tailwind CSS's utility classes, and referring to Tailwind CSS documentation and tutorials.

- **Code Reviews and Collaborative Problem-Solving:** Collaborative code reviews and brainstorming sessions with mentors and peers helped address specific challenges. We shared knowledge and solutions, which significantly improved my development process.

## Lessons Learned

Working on GetLinkedAI provided me with valuable lessons and insights, including:

- **Improved CSS Skills:** I significantly improved my CSS skills, mastering the art of designing visually appealing user interfaces with Tailwind CSS.

- **Effective Library Integration:** I learned the importance of in-depth library exploration and proper integration, which enhanced my project's overall quality and efficiency.

- **Collaborative Development:** Collaborative problem-solving and teamwork played a crucial role in overcoming challenges and achieving project goals.

## Technologies Used

GetLinkedAI is built using various technologies and libraries, each serving a specific purpose:

- **Next.js:** I used Next.js as the front-end framework for building a server-rendered React application. It simplifies routing and provides excellent SEO capabilities.

- **React:** React is the core library for building the user interface components, enabling a dynamic and responsive front end.

- **Formik and Yup:** Formik handles form management, while Yup is used for form validation. These libraries together streamline the form-handling process.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS is responsible for styling and layout. I leveraged its utility-first approach for a consistent and responsive design.

- **Axios:** Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the back end, ensuring efficient data handling.

- **React Hot Toast:** React Hot Toast provides toast notifications for user feedback during form submissions and other interactions.
